\label{gp-classification}
Another important class of problems in machine learning is classification. We will consider the following problem. We have a dataset $\{(x_i, y_i) | i = 1, \ldots, n\}$, where $x_i \in \R^d$, $y_i \in \{-1, 1\}$. We want to predict the probabilities of new datapoints $x_*$ belonging to positive class.

We will consider the following model. We will introduce a latent function $f: \R^d \rightarrow \R$ and put a zero-mean GP prior over it. 
$$f \sim \GP(0, k(\cdot, \cdot)).$$
We will then consider the probability of the object $x_*$ belonging to positiva class, to be equal to $\sigma(f(x_*))$ for the chosen sigmoid function $\sigma$.
$$p(y_* = +1 | x_*) = \sigma(f(x_*)).$$

Note, that the graphical for this model is exactly the same, as for regression problem and is given in fig. \ref{gp_graphical_model}.

We will use the logistic function $\sigma(z) = (1 + \exp(-z))^{-1}$, however one can use other sigmoid functions as well.

Now inference can be done in two steps. First, for the new data point $x_*$ we should find the conditional distribution of the value of the latent process $f$ at the new data point $x_*$. This can be computed as follows
\begin{equation}
	\label{classification_conditional}
	p(f_* | X, y, x_*) = \int p(f_* | X, x_*, f) p(f | X, y) df.
\end{equation}
Now, the probability of the positive class is given by marginalizing over the latent variable $f_*$.
\begin{equation}
	\label{classification_class_probability}
	p(y_* = +1 | X, y, x_*) = \int \sigma(f_*) p(f_* | X, y, x_*) df_*.
\end{equation}

Unfortunantely, both the integrals in (\ref{classification_conditional}) and (\ref{classification_class_probability}) are intractable. Thus, we have to use various techniques to approximate these integrals. 

For example, one can use laplace approximation method, which builds a Gaussian approximation $q(f | X, y)$ to the true posterior $p(f | X, y)$. This approximation is obtained, by performing the Taylor expansion of the function $\log p(f | X, y)$ around it's maximum $\hat f$. 

Substituting this Gaussian approximation back into (\ref{classification_conditional}) and (\ref{classification_class_probability}), we obtain tractable integrals, and can compute the predictive distribution in a closed form. The more detailed derivation of this algorithm and another algorithm, based on Expectation Propagation can be found in \cite{GPinML}.

We will also describe another method for GP-classification below.

Computational complexity of computing the predictive distribution for this method scales as $\bigO(n^3)$.
